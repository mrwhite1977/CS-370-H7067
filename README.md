Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was given most of the program's code. I was given the following code: to set up the environment and track the changing states after each move, to set up the replay experience to aid the algorithm in learning, the complete neural network implementation, and the play function to execute the game and inform the algorithm when it wins. I developed the Q-Training algorithm for the Treasure Hunt game. My goal was to create the best possible navigation sequence that maximizes rewards to train the AI. I read through the given code to understand how each part worked. And this helped me determine a roadmap to create the Q-training algorithm. I determined the balance between exploitation and exploration would be about 3:1. This ensured that the algorithm had enough freedom to explore and learn while using rewards to take that collected knowledge and drive toward the main goal: solving the maze as quickly as possible.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

  Computer scientists are problem solvers. Regardless of the problem we face, we take the tools, knowledge, and resources we have at our disposal to determine how to best solve the issue at hand. For me, I like to review the project requirements first to make sure I fully understand what is being asked of me. I then start to build a roadmap of how to attain those goals. If any code is provided, I will review each module and refine the roadmap. With all this information, I then determine how best to meet each goal. And I must balance what I think is the best option with what works best for the organization and the end user. My idea might create bugs for the existing code causing loss of time and money for the organization as well as frustration for the users' experience. I also must ensure that privacy and security are top of mind when developing code. With the IoT and always-on connections, the world is as interconnected as it has ever been. Computer scientists have an ethical responsibility to protect their clients (organizations) and their end users through thoughtful development and adopting best practices.
